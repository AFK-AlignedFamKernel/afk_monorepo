## Implementation Details

### Emoji Picker

The emoji picker is implemented as a modal that appears when the emoji button is clicked. The user can select an emoji, which is then inserted at the current cursor position in the note text.

Key functions:
- `toggleEmojiPicker()` - Shows/hides the emoji modal
- `handleEmojiSelect(emoji)` - Inserts the selected emoji at cursor position

### Markdown Support

Markdown support is indicated by the MD button, which shows a tooltip explaining available markdown syntax. The note text is sent as-is with markdown syntax, and rendering is handled by the client.

### User Mentions

User mentions are detected when the user types '@' followed by text. A search is performed to find matching users, and when a user is selected, they are mentioned using the nostr 'p' tag format.

Key functions:
- `handleTextChange(text)` - Detects @ symbols and shows user search results
- `handleUserSelect(user)` - Inserts the user mention and adds the 'p' tag

### nostr:nprofile Format

The `pubkeyToNprofile` and `parseNprofile` functions in `utils/nostr.ts` provide utilities for converting between different formats of nostr profile references.

## Customization

To customize these features:
- Add/remove emojis by editing the emoji grids
- Change markdown syntax support by modifying the tooltip information
- Adjust styling in the styles file
- Modify user search behavior by changing the search parameters

## Testing

The implementation includes various levels of testing:
1. Full integration in the app
2. Standalone TestFeatures component
3. HTML demo of the features

If you need to adjust the implementation, the HTML demo provides a clear example of how each feature works, which can be applied to the React Native components.
