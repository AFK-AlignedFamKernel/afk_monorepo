# DN404

DN404 is a standard for joined ERC20 + ERC721 tokens.

The functionality and implementation is similar to this repo: https://github.com/Vectorized/dn404

This implementation consists of the following contracts:

- `dn404_component.cairo`: Contains `DN404Component`, that implements ERC20 side of the token, also stores the main logic and metadata
- `dn404_mirror_component.cairo`: Contains `DN404MirrorComponent`, that implements ERC721 side of the token, acts as a proxy for the `dn404_component.cairo`
- `dn404_preset.cairo`: Contains `DN404Preset`, an example preset for `dn404_component.cairo`, that adds token URI for each NFT
- `dn404_mirror_preset.cairo`: Contains `DN404MirrorPreset`, an example preset for `dn404_mirror_component.cairo` with no extra functionality
